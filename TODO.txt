* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Play In Editor (PIE) Viewport
	(for the time being, Eject from the PIE viewport to get access to the HUD buttons)

* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Standalone Viewport launched via the Editor	
	(for the time being, use the console command 'RenderDoc.CaptureFrame')

* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Standalone Game builds
	(this might be tricky since the plugin has Type=Developer, and Standalone executables
	 require Type=Runtime so that the plugin code is linked statically against the .exe)




Prompt user if he is sure he wants to recompile all shaders
Explain that this will rebuild all shaders, and it will lock the editor while the shaders are building

Force recompile all shaders





Amend forum post with info on how to set the shader debug info manually
