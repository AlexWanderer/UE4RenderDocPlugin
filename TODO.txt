1. Try to read reg key, if failed go to (2). If success go to (3)
2. Launch browse for file dialog and browse for renderdocui exe
3. Save directory of renderdoc path in UE4 config file
4. Read directory from config file when needed


Fix capture hotkey
Make capture possible
Launch renderdoc on button press

Need to unload properly   (Oculus wtf? Eject function?)
Distro RenderDoc?
Attach UI to running instance on launch
Need to find correct window with focus on startup and keep it
Need to be able to hide text

Would be nice to only have one plugin
Choose path instead of %appdata%/../local/temp/UE4Editor_date_frameN.rdc
