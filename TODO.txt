* Capture callstack setting does not appear to be working...

* Better integration with the many different viewports:
  At the moment, only the main Editor viewport contains the plugin's capture and settings buttons.
	These buttons should be available on other viewports, such as:
  * "Play In Editor" (PIE) viewport
	  (for the time being, Eject from the PIE viewport to get access to the HUD buttons)
  * "Standalone Game" viewports launched via the Editor
	  (for the time being, use the console command 'RenderDoc.CaptureFrame')
  * Tool preview viewports, such the ones in the Material Editor, Persona, Cascade, etc.
    (for the time being, rendering activity on these preview viewports can be intercepted
	   by activating the "capture all activity" toggle in the plugin settings)

* It would also be nice to have the 'BinaryPath' configuration understand and parse
  a RenderDoc installation location relative to the Engine or Game by using the same
  syntax of content/asset reference paths like '/Engine/...' and '/Game/...' (at the
  moment, it is necessary to use ../.. before /Engine and /Game).



Prompt user if he is sure he wants to recompile all shaders
Explain that this will rebuild all shaders, and it will lock the editor while the shaders are building

Set Global input variable
D:\My Projects\UnrealEngine\Engine\Config\ConsoleVariables  DumpShaderDebugInfo
GDumpShaderDebugInfo

Force recompile all shaders





Amend forum post with info on how to set the shader debug info manually
Create branch that contains the UI and other code to set the render flag automatically



Engine:
Release buffers in correct spot
Shader compile problem

Release:
Post in forum
Post in wiki

Tests:
Spam capture button
See that tests are loaded correctly on: Startup, after set.

Backlog:
Maybe remove irrelevant tabs in renderdoc UI when launched from UE4? Like Launch process tab etc.
