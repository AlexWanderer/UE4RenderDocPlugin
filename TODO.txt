* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Play In Editor (PIE) Viewport
	(for the time being, Eject from the PIE viewport to get access to the HUD buttons)

* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Standalone Viewport launched via the Editor	
	(for the time being, use the console command 'RenderDoc.CaptureFrame')

* Make the Plugin HUD buttons available on Standalone Game builds
	(this might be tricky since the plugin has Type=Developer, and Standalone executables
	 require Type=Runtime so that the plugin code is linked statically against the .exe)

* It would be nice to make have both plugins merged together... Is there a way for the
  Loader plugin to register a callback for when the Editor UI extensions are initialized?

* It would also be nice to have the 'BinaryPath' configuration understand and parse
  a RenderDoc installation location rleative to the Engine or Game by using the same
  syntax of content/asset reference paths like '/Engine/...' and '/Game/...' (at the
  moment, it is necessary to use ../.. before /Engine and /Game).
  


Prompt user if he is sure he wants to recompile all shaders
Explain that this will rebuild all shaders, and it will lock the editor while the shaders are building

Set Global input variable
D:\My Projects\UnrealEngine\Engine\Config\ConsoleVariables  DumpShaderDebugInfo
GDumpShaderDebugInfo

Force recompile all shaders





Amend forum post with info on how to set the shader debug info manually
Create branch that contains the UI and other code to set the render flag automatically



Engine:
Release buffers in correct spot
Shader compile problem

Release:
Post in forum
Post in wiki

Tests:
Spam capture button
See that tests are loaded correctly on: Startup, after set.

Backlog:
Maybe remove irrelevant tabs in renderdoc UI when launched from UE4? Like Launch process tab etc.
