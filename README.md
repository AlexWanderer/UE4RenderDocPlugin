UE4RenderDocPlugin
==================

A plugin that adds easy access to Renderdoc inside UE4

How to use
==================
Start by installing the latest version of renderdoc from: http://renderdoc.org/builds.
Just copy all the content of this repo into your Project/Plugins/ folder and you should be good to go!
After you've loaded the plugins you should have a new button in the editor UI that lets you capture and it launches Renderdoc for you with the fresh capture. :)

I would recommend using any of the r/ branches since those are the most stable and has no "dangling" features.
